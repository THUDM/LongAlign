Abstract
Extending large language models to effectively
handle long contexts requires instruction fine-
tuning on input sequences of similar length. To
address this, we present LongAlign—a recipe
of the instruction data, training, and evalua-
tion for long context alignment. First, we con-
struct a long instruction-following dataset us-
ing Self-Instruct. To ensure the data diversity,
it covers a broad range of tasks from various
long context sources. Second, we adopt the
packing and sorted batching strategies to speed
up supervised fine-tuning on data with varied
length distributions. Additionally, we develop
a loss weighting method to balance the contri-
bution to the loss across different sequences
during packing training. Third, we introduce
the LongBench-Chat benchmark for evaluating
instruction-following capabilities on queries of
10k-100k in length. Experiments show that
LongAlign outperforms existing recipes for
LLMs in long context tasks by up to 30%, while
also maintaining their proficiency in handling
short, generic tasks. The code, data, and long-
aligned models are open-sourced at https:
//github.com/THUDM/LongAlign.
1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) with large context
windows facilitate tasks such as summarization,
question answering on long text and code (Bai et al.,
2023a). Importantly, they may form the founda-
tional support for life-long conversations and com-
plex agent scenarios (Xiao et al., 2023; Liu et al.,
2023). Existing works to build long-context LLMs
predominantly focus on context extension (Chen
et al., 2023a; Xiong et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023),
that is, position encoding extension and continual
training on long text.
In this work, we instead focus on the perspec-
tive of long context alignment, i.e., instruction
fine-tuning LLMs to handle long user prompts.

tains real-world queries of 10k-100k in length

.
However, several challenges are required to ad-
dress. First, there is an absence of long instruction-
following datasets for supervised fine-tuning (SFT),
and by extension the lack of methods for construct-
ing such data. Second, the varied length distribu-
tion of long-context data drastically reduces the
training efficiency of traditional batching methods
in a multi-GPU setup, as GPUs processing shorter
inputs have to stay idle until those handling longer
inputs complete their tasks. Third, there is a crucial
need for a robust benchmark to evaluate LLMs’
long-context capacities against real-world queries.
To address them, we present the LongAlign
recipe, covering data, efficient training, and eval-
uation, respectively. Data-wise, to construct a di-
verse long instruction-following dataset, we collect
long sequences from nine sources and use Self-
Instruct (Wang et al., 2022) to generate 10k instruc-
tion data of 8k-64k length.
Training-wise, to address the inefficiency un-
der uneven batching, we adopt the packing strat-
egy (Krell et al., 2021) that packs sequences to-

LongAlign-6B-64k, LongAlign-7B-64k and LongAlign-
13B-64k are trained based on ChatGLM3-6B, Llama-2-7B
and Llama-2-13B, respectively.

gether up to the maximum length before dispatch-
ing them to GPUs. However, we identified a bias
in loss averaging during this packing training, as
packs containing different numbers of sequences
are assigned equal weight in the final loss calcu-
lation. To mitigate this bias, we propose a loss
weighting strategy to balance contributions to the
loss across different sequences. In addition, we
introduce a sorted batching method that groups se-
quences of similar lengths to reduce the intra-batch
idle time.
Evaluation-wise, we develop LongBench-Chat,
a benchmark compromising open-ended questions
of 10k-100k length annotated by Ph.D. students.
It covers diverse aspects of instruction-following
abilities such as reasoning, coding, summarization,
and multilingual translation over long contexts.
GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023b) is employed to score the
machine-generated responses based on our anno-
tated groundtruths and few-shot scoring examples.
Extensive experiments show that LongAlign ef-
fectively aligns models to handle contexts of up to
64k tokens in length while maintaining their per-
formance on general tasks without degradation. In
addition, we have the following findings:
• 
Impact of Data Quantity and Diversity: Both
the quantity and the diversity of the long in-
struction data significantly influence the aligned
model’s ability to handle long contexts, impact-
ing final performance by up to 30%.
• Benefits of Long Instruction Data: The amount
of long instruction data positively affects the per-
formance on long-context tasks while does not
hurt the models’ short-context handling capaci-
ties.
• Effectiveness of Training Strategies: The pack-
ing and sorted batching strategies adopted can
accelerate training by over 100% without perfor-
mance compromise. Furthermore, the proposed
loss weighting technique improves long context
performance by 10%.

Long Context Scaling. Long context scaling aims
to expand the limited context length of existing
LLMs to support long context tasks (Xiong et al.,
2023). The current methods for long context scal-
ing can be divided into two categories: those that
require fine-tuning or continual training on longer
sequences and those that do not. Methods that do
not require fine-tuning often employ techniques
such as sliding window attention (Han et al., 2023;
Xiao et al., 2023) or neighboring token compres-
sion (Jiang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Jin et al.,
2024) to handle the positional O.O.D. problem in
attention computation for long contexts. These
methods, although capable of extending the context
length of LLMs in a plug-and-play manner, still
cannot match the performance of the fine-tuned
approaches. Prominent fine-tuned approaches for
long context scaling (Chen et al., 2023a; Peng et al.,
2023; Xiong et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b; Zhu
et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023) typically involve posi-
tion encoding extension and continual pretraining
on longer sequences.
LLM Alignment. Following the previous steps
of long context scaling, it is vital to also align the
model with instruction-following data to ensure
that it can interact with various user requests in a
chat interface (Wang et al., 2023). This phase, often
referred to as supervised fine-tuning or instruction-
tuning, has been extensively studied in short con-
text scenarios (Wang et al., 2022; Taori et al., 2023;
Wang et al., 2023; Tunstall et al., 2023). How-
ever, the introduction of long sequences presents
unique challenges in terms of data, training meth-
ods, and evaluation for alignment. Xiong et al.
(2023) proposes generating long instruction data
by concatenating short instruction data, yet their
dataset and model weight are not open-sourced.
On the other hand, while Chen et al. (2023b) has
made their long instruction data, LongAlpaca-12k,
available and employed LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) for
efficient fine-tuning, it lacks in-depth discussion
and comparative analysis of the influence of data
and training methodologies. Our work aims to find
an optimal solution for supervised (full parameter)
fine-tuning on long context with full attention, by
tuning data, training methods, and evaluating the
aligned models on a wide range of tasks.

In this section, we discuss the methodology in Lon-
gAlign, involving the data construction process,
training method, and evaluation benchmark.

pervised fine-tuning on high-quality pairs of in-

3.2 Dataset Construction
Long instruction data typically involves a long con-
text material, such as a book, an extensive docu-
ment, or a lengthy code, accompanied by a task
query that requires summarizing, reasoning, or
computing based on the material. During construc-
tion, we first collect long articles and documents
from 9 varied sources, covering books, encyclope-
dias, academic papers, codes, etc. We then employ
Claude 2.1 (Anthropic, 2023) to generate tasks and
answers according to a given long context, as illus-
trated in Figure 2. To foster a diverse range of gen-
erated tasks, we incorporate task type descriptions
into the prompts, such as queries for summaries,
information extraction, reasoning, etc. Using this
methodology, we create tasks and answers for 10k
lengthy texts, yielding a total of 10k instances of
supervised data, of which 10% is in Chinese. The
length of these data ranges from 8k to 64k, mea-
sured by ChatGLM tokenizer (Zeng et al., 2023)
due to its higher compression rate for Chinese char-
acters. Details regarding the prompts and the data
construction process can be found in Appendix A.
3.3 Efficient Long-Context Training
To ensure that the model retains the ability to han-
dle both long and short texts (general capability)
after SFT, we mix the long instruction data with a
general instruction dataset for training. The mix-
ture of a large amount of general short data with a
relatively smaller amount of long instruction data
results in a long-tail data length distribution. As
shown in Figure 3 left, the majority of the data falls
within the 0-8k length range, while the remaining
data is fairly evenly distributed in the 8k-64k length
interval. Under this distribution, during training,
a data batch typically contains mostly short data,
yet these batches also include a few longer texts
which necessitate much more computation times,
resulting in considerable idle times. To minimize
these idle times, the most effective approach is to
concatenate or sort the data in a manner that en-
sures a more uniform length and computational
time within each batch. Bearing this in mind, we
explore two training methods, namely packing and
sorted batching.
Packing. It involves concatenating data of vary-
ing lengths together until reaching the maxi-
mum length. The resulting packed data, whose
lengths are generally close to the maximum length,
are then batched and processed on multi-GPUs.
This approach effectively minimizes the idle time
within each batch, as depicted in the upper right
of Figure 3. Additionally, to prevent cross-
contamination between different sequences within
the same pack during self-attention calculation,
we pass a list containing the starting and ending
positions of different sequences and utilize the
flash_attn_varlen_func from FlashAtten-
tion 2 (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023), which supports
efficient computation of block diagonal attention
(see Appendix B for more details). It requires less
computation and IO time compared to the tradi-
tional use of a 2D attention mask.
However, we notice that the packing strategy
leads to a bias towards longer sequences and se-
quences containing more target tokens. This is
because different packs, each contributing equally
to the final loss, contain varying numbers of se-
quences with different numbers of target tokens.
Consequently, when calculating the mean loss for
each batch, sequences in packs with fewer se-
quences (typically the longer ones) or those con-
taining more target tokens, have a greater influence
on the final loss. Formally, consider M sequences
packed into a batch of K packs where the i-th pack
consists of the sequences with indices in [P
i−1
, P
i
),
thus it holds that P

this inequality, we propose to scale the loss in the

M ) and instead take the
sum of the scaled loss on each pack, which results
in an equal loss to Eq. 2:

As demonstrated in our experimental section, the
loss weighting strategy results in a 10% improve-
ment in downstream tasks.
Sorted batching. We also consider an efficient
sorted batching strategy for training (lower right
of Figure 3). To ensure that the sequences within
each batch are of similar lengths, we sort the data
by length and select a random consecutive group
of data for each batch, with no repetition. However,
this strategy inevitably introduces a bias in the data
distribution across different batches, where batches
consist either of all long sequences or all short
sequences. This can be potentially disastrous for
SGD optimization. In our experiments, we observe
that sorted batching significantly accelerates the
process without a noticeable negative impact on
performance. This might be attributed to our use
of large gradient accumulation steps and the strong
adaptability of the optimizer.
3.4 LongBench-Chat
Although there are existing benchmarks for evalu-
ating LLMs’ long context understanding (An et al.,
2023; Bai et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2023b), they do
not focus on assessing their instruction-following
capability under long context. Furthermore, their
reliance on automatic metrics for evaluation limits
the assessment of aligned models’ longer and more
diverse outputs to real-world queries, and how their
responses align with human preference.
To this end, we propose LongBench-Chat, which
includes 50 long context real-world queries rang-
ing from 10k to 100k in length, covering various
key user-intensive scenarios such as document QA,
summarization, and coding. It consists of 40 tasks
in English and 10 in Chinese. To ensure the eval-
uation truly reflects the model’s ability to follow
long context instructions, we avoid using popular
long texts that are likely to have been seen and
memorized by the model during pretraining. We
also avoid posing questions that the model could
answer without reading the long text.
For evaluation, following previous works that
have shown the effectiveness of using LLM as an
evaluator (Bai et al., 2023b; Zheng et al., 2023; Ke
et al., 2023), we employ GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023b)
to score the model’s response in 1-10 based on a
given human-annotated referenced answer and few-
shot scoring examples for each question. We only
pass the short query (without the long document)
to the evaluator, as currently there is no model
capable of evaluating the quality of responses under
long context inputs. To ensure that the evaluator
can make informed judgments based solely on the
groundtruth and few-shot scoring examples, we
steer clear of overly open-ended questions, such as
“Write a poem based on the preceding text”.
To validate the reliability of using GPT-4 as an
evaluator on LongBench-Chat, we conduct a hu-

In Table 1, we present the correlation between GPT-
4’s assessments using zero-shot prompting, which
involves only the referenced answer, and its evalu-
ations with additional few-shot scoring examples,
compared to crowdsourced human judgments. We
also show the inter-annotator correlation in the first
column. We find that with few-shot prompting,
GPT-4’s correlation with human annotations not
only aligns but also surpasses the level of agree-
ment among human annotators, proving the relia-
bility of such a metric on LongBench-Chat. We
further discover that the overall average scores (1-
10) obtained using GPT-4+Few-shot differ by an
average of 0.1 or less from the scores given by
human experts. Additionally, we do not observe
a significant bias in GPT-4’s scoring towards the
length of responses — in fact, it even penalizes
excessively lengthy responses.
Leaderboard. Figure 1 reports the test results of
current long context (16k+) instruction fine-tuned
models (chat models) and our most competent
models trained with LongAlign on LongBench-
Chat. We include API-based Commercial mod-
els: GPT-4-1106-preview (OpenAI, 2023a) (GPT-
4 Turbo), GLM-4-128k
2
, and Claude-2.1 (An-
thropic, 2023); as well as open-sourced models:
InternLM2-7b-200k, InternLM2-20b-200k (Team,
2023), ChatGLM3-6B-32k (Du et al., 2022; Zeng
et al., 2023), Vicuna-7b-v1.5-16k (Zheng et al.,
2023), Orion-14b-LongChat (Chen et al., 2024),
LongChat-7b-v1.5-32k (Li et al., 2023a), and
Mixtral-8x7b-Instruct-v0.2 (Jiang et al., 2024).
Note that we employ middle truncation for inputs
surpassing the model’s context window. Our evalu-
ation result reveals that the performance of current
open-sourced models still significantly lags behind
commercial models, which partially attributed to
the scale difference between these models. Addi-
tionally, we observe that models with a context
length of 32k or less tend to underperform on
LongBench-Chat, indicating that a longer context
window is necessary to complete these long tasks.

4 Experiments
In this section, we aim to answer the following
research questions through a series of experiments:
RQ1. During SFT, how does the quantity and di-
versity of the long instruction data influence the
model’s performance in downstream tasks.
RQ2. Whether incorporating long instruction data
during training affects the model’s general capabili-
ties and their instruction-following / conversational
abilities in short context scenarios.
RQ3. The impact that the packing and sorted batch-
ing training methods have on the training efficiency
and the final performance of the models.
We also incorporate discussions on the scalability
of LongAlign on model size and context length,
and the learning curve in long context alignment.
4.1 Experimental Setup
Data. To maintain the model’s general capabilities
and its proficiency in following short instructions,
we utilize ShareGPT (Chiang et al., 2023) (empty
assistant responses are filtered out) as the source
of short instruction data in our training data. To
compare the impact of different aspects of long
instruction data on model training, we incorporate
the following four suites of long instruction data
in our experiment. ‘LongAlign-0k’, ‘LongAlign-
5k’, and ‘LongAlign-10k’: 0, 5k, and 10k instances
of LongAlign data, constructed according to the
procedure in Sec 3.2; ‘LongAlpaca-12k’: 12k data
from the LongAlpaca dataset (Chen et al., 2023b).
LongAlpaca includes 9k long QA data and 3k short
QA data, where the long QA data is generated
based only on academic papers and books, offer-
ing less diversity compared to our LongAlign data.
We use this dataset to compare the impact of the
diversity of long instruction data on model training.
Model. We include three model variants, namely
ChatGLM3-6B (Du et al., 2022; Zeng et al., 2023),
Llama-2-7B, and Llama-2-13B (Touvron et al.,
2023) (all base models). Given their 8k and 4k con-
text windows, we first perform context extension
to extend their context window to 64k, resulting in
ChatGLM3-6B-64k, Llama-2-7B-64k, and Llama-
2-13B-64k. This involves expanding the base fre-
quency b of the RoPE position encoding (Su et al.,
2024) by 200 times (from 10,000 to 2,000,000) and
continual training on pretraining data with lengths
under 64k, for a total of 10 billion tokens
3
.

Continual training on 10B tokens is sufficient for context
extension, as suggested in Fu et al. (2023).

mixed with ShareGPT.
Training. All models are trained with 8xA800
80G GPUs and DeepSpeed+ZeRO3+CPU offload-
ing (Rasley et al., 2020). The models can be trained
with a maximum length of 64k tokens without GPU
memory overflow. Consequently, we set the max-
imum length of the training data to 64k, with any
data exceeding this length being truncated from the
right. For packing training, each pack consists of
12 sequences on average, we set the total batch size
to 8, resulting in a global batch size of 96. For a
fair comparison, we set the batch size to 8, with
a gradient accumulation step of 12 for other non-
packing training methods. We train 2 epochs on
the training data (approximately 1500-2000 steps).
Evaluation. We involve both long context tasks
and short context tasks in evaluation. In both long
and short scenarios, we consider tasks that eval-
uate the instruction-following and conversational
abilities, as well as tasks that assess general ca-
pabilities. For long context tasks, we use our
proposed LongBench-Chat to evaluate the mod-
els’ long context alignment proficiency and employ
LongBench (Bai et al., 2023a) to test the model’s
general long context understanding abilities. Long-
Bench is a bilingual, multi-task long context bench-
mark. We conduct evaluations on three types of
tasks within it: Single-Doc QA, Multi-Doc QA,
and Summarization. Since the aligned models typi-
cally produce longer responses, instead of using the
original metrics (ROUGE, F1) to score the models’
replies, we use GPT-4 to rate the model’s outputs
based on their alignment with the groundtruth an-
swers on LongBench. For short context tasks, we
use MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023), a multi-turn
chat benchmark, to measure the models’ ability to
follow short instructions. We also evaluate on the
general tasks on Open LLM Leaderboard (Beech-
ing et al., 2023), including ARC (Clark et al.,
2018), HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), Truthful
QA (Lin et al., 2022), and MMLU (Hendrycks
et al., 2021). We follow the evaluation settings
in the Open LLM Leaderboard and utilize lm-
evaluation-harness framework (Gao et al., 2023)
for evaluation on these tasks. To ensure the most
stable evaluation results, we use GPT-4 to score
twice on LongBench-Chat and MT-Bench, and av-
erage these scores to obtain the final score.
4.2 Influence of Data
We conduct SFT on ChatGLM3-6B-64k using
ShareGPT data mixed with different suites of long
instruction data. All models except LongAlign-0k
are trained using the more efficient packing strat-
egy with loss weighting. The evaluation results are
reported in Table 2. For LongBench-Chat and MT-
Bench, the reported results are averaged over GPT-
4’s rating (1-10) across all test instances, while
results on other datasets are normalized between 0-
100. We also conduct the “Needle in A HayStack”
experiment
4 
(result visualization in Figure 4) to test
the model’s ability to utilize information from 10
different positions within long contexts of varying
lengths between 1k-60k. Specifically, this task asks
for the model to retrieve a piece of fact (the ‘nee-
dle’) that is inserted in the middle (positioned at a
specified depth percent) of a long context window

(the ‘haystack’). We summarize our key findings
on the influence of data as follows.
1. More long instruction data enhances the per-
formance in long tasks, and without compro-
mising the performance in short tasks. Compar-
ing the performance of LongAlign-0k, LongAlign-
5k, and LongAlign-10k, we observe that as the
amount of long instruction data increases, there
is a consistent improvement in the model’s per-
formance across all long tasks. Meanwhile, in-
triguingly, its performance on short tasks remains
comparable to when it is trained solely on short
instructions. Additionally, given the inferior perfor-
mance of LongAlign-0k in long tasks (especially on
LongBench-Chat), this also indicates that merely
performing context extension on the base model is
insufficient to ensure good performance on down-
stream long tasks. It is necessary to incorporate a
substantial amount of long data covering various
lengths during SFT. Moreover, the needle test re-
sult also suggests that more long data enhances the
model’s ability to utilize information from different
positions within long texts, resulting in a decrease
of the model’s retrieval error.
2. Diversity of long instruction data is benefi-
cial for the model’s instruction-following abil-
ities. LongAlign-10k shows significantly better
results in long and short instruction-following
tasks (LongBench-Chat and MTBench), compared
to LongAlpaca-12k. Meanwhile, LongAlpaca-
12k slightly outperforms LongAlign-10k on Long-
Bench. This is primarily due to its superior per-
formance on the 2WikiMQA (Ho et al., 2020) and
NarrativeQA (Koˇcisk 
`
y et al., 2018) datasets, which
are based on Wikipedia and novels, bearing more
resemble to the source of the instruction data in
LongAlpaca-12k.

4.3 Impact of Training Methods
We compare different training methods on
ChatGLM3-6B-64k and Llama-2-6B-64k, includ-
ing naïve batching, packing (w/ and w/o loss
weighting), and sorted batching, to assess their
impact on training efficiency, as well as their in-
fluence on downstream task performance.
5 
All
models are trained on LongAlign-10k. Figure 5
displays a comparison of the training time required
for each method. Table 3 presents the performance
on downstream tasks. Our findings are as follows.
1. Packing and sorted batching double the
training efficiency while exhibiting good per-
formance. From Figure 5, we can see that the
training efficiency of packing and sorted batch-
ing is comparable, both requiring less than half
the time needed under naïve batching. Addition-
ally, according to table 3, models trained with the
two efficient methods perform comparably to those
trained with naïve batching on both long and short
tasks. We also find that the effectiveness of these
two training methods varies with different models.
5
Naïve batching and sorted batching consume more GPU
memory compared to packing, due to their use of gradient
accumulation. We truncate all data to 56k length for ChatGLM
with these two methods to ensure no GPU memory overflow.

Table 4: Scaling up: LongAlign on LLama-2-13B.
For instance, the model trained on ChatGLM3-6B
using packing+loss weighting shows significantly
better performance on LongBench-Chat, whereas
sorted batching performs the best for Llama-2-7B.
2. Loss weighting significantly improves per-
formance on long instruction task for packing
training. By comparing the performance of mod-
els with and without loss weighting strategy during
packing training, it’s evident that incorporating the
loss weighting strategy greatly improves the ca-
pability in LongBench-Chat (by about 5%∼10%),
while having a minimal and variable impact on the
performance of other tasks. We believe that this is
primarily because, without loss weighting in SFT
data, different long instruction data contribute vari-
ably to the loss — longer data tend to contribute
more to the loss (refer to Eq. 3). Such an unnat-
ural weighting bias is often detrimental to model
training, potentially leading to training instability,
deviating it from the optimal learning trajectory.
4.4 Discussion
Scalability of LongAlign. We explore two scaling
directions on our LongAlign framework: larger
model size and longer context window. To do so,
we fine-tune Llama-2-13B-64k using LongAlign-
10k dataset with the two efficient training meth-
ods, and the evaluation results are shown in Ta-
ble 4. Compared to the 7B-scale model, the 13B
model shows a 10% improvement on LongBench-
Chat, setting a new record among open-sourced
models (LongAlign-13B-64k in Figure 1). This
indicates that our alignment method scales effec-
tively to larger-scale models. We also construct
SFT data up to 128k in length with human annota-
tion and successfully align ChatGLM3-6B under
128k context window using packing training with
loss weighting, resulting in ChatGLM3-6B-128k
(performance shown in Figure 1).

training, illustrating how performance varies with
the number of training steps. We use exponen-
tial moving average to smooth the original perfor-
mance curves (dotted lines), and display them as
solid lines. We observe that the trends of the two
learning curves are strikingly similar — both show
rapid improvement between 0-500 steps, followed
by a slow rise, and stabilize after 1000 steps. This
may imply a deeper connection between long and
short alignment. They might be jointly determined
by shared latent factors, which are optimized dur-
ing training to help the model align to both long
and short instructions simultaneously.
In Appendix D, we provide case analyses
of different LongAlign-tuned models on out-of-
distribution (OOD) long context query, that is,
query that the models have not encountered in the
long context SFT data. We find that models trained
with LongAlign can generalize to OOD long con-
text queries, such as writing a review for a research
paper, and that larger-scale models have stronger
generalization capabilities.
5 Conclusion
This paper aims to find the best practice for long
context alignment in the scope of data, training
method, and evaluation. Our proposed solution,
namely LongAlign, uses Self-Instruct to construct
diverse long instruction data, and efficiently fine-
tune the model with packing combined with loss
weighting or sorted batching. Moreover, we in-
troduce LongBench-Chat to facilitate reliable as-
8

sessment of LLM’s instruction-following ability
on practical long context interactions. Through
controlled experiments, we find that the amount,
diversity of data, as well as the correct training
method, are crucial to the final performance.

along with their copyright information:
• Arxiv (Academic papers): Open-accessed and can be downloaded freely by anyone.
• Books3 (Books): From The Pile, currently it is not licensed to be downloaded.
• C4 Dataset (Various types of articles): Publicly available dataset with ODC-BY license.
• CLUECorpus2020 (Various types of Chinese articles): Extracted Chinese instances from the Common-
Crawl corpus by Xu et al. (2020).

• Wikipedia (Encyclopedias): Grant free access and licensed under CC BY-SA.
• WuDaoCorpora (Various types of articles): open-accessed dataset.
We sample articles with lengths under 64k (measured by ChatGLM3-6B tokenizer) from these datasets.
Note that we upsample longer articles to ensure our dataset covers more long texts.
Prompts for data generation. During the data generation process, we employ four types of task prompts
to encourage Claude to produce a more diverse set of instruction data:
• General type task
{Long Doc}
Given the above text, please propose 5 English questions that are diverse and cover all
parts of the text, in the following format: "1: ", "2: ", ...
• Summary type task
{Long Doc}
Given the above text, please propose 5 English questions that require summarization or
integration from multiple parts, make sure they are diverse and cover all parts of the text, in the
following format: "1: ", "2: ", ...
• Reasoning type task
{Long Doc}
Given the above text, please propose 5 English questions that require multi-hop reason-
ing, make sure they are diverse and cover all parts of the text, in the following format: "1: ", "2: ",
...
• Information extraction type task
{Long Doc}
Given the above text, please propose 5 English information-seeking questions, make sure
they are diversed and cover all parts of the text, in the following format: "1: ", "2: ", ...
6
Arxiv, Books3, CC, Github, Stack Exchange, and Wikipedia are sampled from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020).
12

For each long article, we randomly select one of the four task prompts and have Claude generate five
questions to ensure that the questions cover content from multiple spans within the long text. We then
randomly choose one of these questions and request Claude for its answer, resulting in instruction data as
illustrated in Figure 2. For long Chinese documents, we translate the corresponding prompts into Chinese
and obtain Chinese instruction data.
B Training Method Details
Here we provide details regarding the implementation of the packing strategy and loss weighting. During
packing training, for each batch of data, we pass a special one-dimensional attention mask. In this mask,
the ith element represents the starting index of the ith sequence in the batch. The first element of the
mask is 0, and the last element is equal to batch_size × seq_len. During the attention computation, we
use the flash_attn_varlen_func function from FlashAttention 2 and pass the attention mask to
the function’s cu_seqlens_q and cu_seqlens_k parameters. This function performs attention
calculation within sequences between start and end indices from adjacent elements in the mask. Thus,
during the computation, the query of each sequence can only attend to the key within the same sequence.
For implementation of the loss weighting strategy, we first preprocess the training data to produce a
weighted 1D mask for each pack of sequences, where the weight is set to 1/N (N is the number of target
tokens in current sequence) on the position corresponding to target tokens, otherwise 0. During training,
we set M and K, i.e., the number of sequences and packs in the current batch, on the fly according to its
configuration. Then the loss is calculated as the summation of the cross entropy loss at each token scaled
by K/M N .
C Evaluation Details
C.1 LongBench-Chat
Evaluation data. 30 question data in LongBench-Chat are proposed by our author team to best mimic
real user queries, these include 20 English and 10 Chinese questions. The remaining 20 questions in
LongBench-Chat are selected from long dependency QA tasks in the LooGLE dataset (Li et al., 2023b).
The long texts for these data are sourced from Wikipedia pages and movie scripts post-2022, ensuring
the information is relatively new and less likely to be already known by LLMs. We aim to select
questions that resemble real user inquiries, can be answered from the text, and ensure a diverse type of
questions (including Comprehension & Reasoning, Multiple Information Retrieval, Timeline Reorder, and
Computation types). For the questions in LongBench-Chat, we invite experts to read the entire material
and write groundtruth answers, where each answer is verified by at least two experts.
Evaluation prompts. For each question, we manually score on three responses as few-shot scoring
examples, shuffle their order in each evaluation run and use the following prompt to get GPT-4’s evaluation:
[Instructions] You are asked to evaluate the quality of the AI assistant’s answers to user questions as
an impartial judge, and your evaluation should take into account factors including correctness (high
priority), helpfulness, accuracy, and relevance. The scoring principles are as follows: 1. Read the
AI assistant’s answer and compare the assistant’s answer with the reference answer. 2. Identify all
errors in the AI Assistant’s answers and consider how much they affect the answer to the question. 3.
Evaluate how helpful the AI assistant’s answers are in directly answering the user’s questions and
providing the information the user needs. 4. Examine any additional information in the AI assistant’s
answer to ensure that it is correct and closely related to the question. If this information is incorrect
or not relevant to the question, points should be deducted from the overall score.
Please give an overall integer rating from 1 to 10 based on the above principles, strictly in the
following format:"[[rating]]", e.g. "[[5]]".

priority), helpfulness, accuracy, and relevance. The scoring principles are as follows: 1. Read the
AI assistant’s answer and compare the assistant’s answer with the reference answer. 2. Identify all
errors in the AI Assistant’s answers and consider how much they affect the answer to the question. 3.
Evaluate how helpful the AI assistant’s answers are in directly answering the user’s questions and
providing the information the user needs. 4. Examine any additional information in the AI assistant’s
answer to ensure that it is correct and closely related to the question. If this information is incorrect
or not relevant to the question, points should be deducted from the overall score.
Please give an overall integer rating from 1 to 10 based on the above principles, strictly in the
following format:"[[rating]]", e.g. "[[5]]".

Human evaluation. Here we provide more details for the human evaluation study on LongBench-Chat.
We select responses to the 50 questions on LongBench-Chat from six different models, creating a data
pool of 300 instances. We invite two human experts (both are Ph.D. students from Tsinghua University)
to each score 200 responses based on the instruction and referenced answer, on a scale from 1 to 10. The
scoring criteria provided to the human experts are as follows:
Please score the assistant’s response based on the question and the reference answer, with 1
being the lowest and 10 the highest. The annotation must adhere to the following requirements:
1. Focus primarily on whether the response covers the key points in the reference answer.
2. For reference answers containing multiple key points, look for how many of these the response
accurately addresses and score accordingly.
3. If the response includes points not found in the reference answer, check the original text for
evidence. Deduct points at your discretion if it does not align with the original text.
4. Also consider deducting points for overly verbose responses or those that are excessively
generalized.
Evaluation cost. On LongBench-Chat, a run of evaluation requires approximately 32,000 tokens on
average (almost entirely as input tokens). Therefore, using GPT-4 for evaluation would cost about $0.96
per run.
C.2 LongBench
Evaluation prompts. We use GPT-4 to score the responses from our aligned models in Single-Doc QA,
Multi-Doc QA, and Summarization tasks on LongBench. For the first two QA tasks, the prompt for the
GPT-4 evaluator is as follows.

Evaluation cost. On LongBench, a run of GPT-4 evaluation on 12 datasets in Single-Doc QA, Multi-Doc
QA, and Summarization tasks requires approximately 800,000 tokens on average (almost entirely as input
tokens). Therefore, using GPT-4 for evaluation would cost about $24 per run.
C.3 Needle Test
For the “Needle in A Haystack” evaluation, following the original configuration in the original github
repository, we use “The best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on
a sunny day.” as the needle fact, and Paul Graham’s essays as the long haystack context. We use the
query prompt from Claude 2.1

: “What is the best thing to do in San Francisco? Here is the most relevant
sentence in the context:”.
D Case Studies on OOD Queries
As part of our research on aligning LLMs on long context, we come up with an intriguing and practical
case study: Can we evaluate the long context understanding capability of our trained models using this
paper as the long input? Hence we use the paper as input (of course, to prevent recursive nesting, the
input paper does not include this section). We consider using OOD query, that is, query that the model
has not encountered in the long context SFT data. Our queries include “From a professional reviewer’s
perspective, identify the strengths and weaknesses of this paper” and “Use rap to tell about this paper”.
Let’s see how the model variants response:

We remove the Abstract, Conclusion, and Limitations sections in the input to prevent the model from simply copying content
from these sections without demonstrating its own understanding.

3 LongAlign-6B-64k (ChatGLM3-6B-64k trained on LongAlign-10k using packing + loss
weighting):
As an AI language model, I cannot provide a subjective review as I lack the ability to evaluate the
quality of the paper based on personal biases or predispositions. However, I can provide an objective
analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the paper.
Strengths:
1. Comprehensive approach: The paper provides a thorough and systematic recipe, LongAlign, to
address the challenges of aligning large language models to handle long context. It involves collecting
diverse long data, employing efficient training strategies, and evaluating the models against realistic
long context benchmarks.
2. Impact of data: The paper demonstrates that the quantity and diversity of long instruction data
significantly impact the model’s ability to handle long contexts, and that incorporating more long data
is beneficial. This provides a valuable perspective on the importance of diverse long context data.
3. Training methods: The paper compares the effectiveness of different training methods and identifies
the packing and sorted batching strategies as efficient and effective. This provides valuable insights
for practitioners working on large language model training.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of a large-scale human evaluation study: The paper does not include a comprehensive large-
scale human evaluation study to validate the performance of the GPT-4 evaluator on LongBench-Chat.
While the correlation with human annotations is presented, a direct comparison between human and
GPT-4’s assessments is lacking.
2. Scalability limits: The paper does not explore the scalability of LongAlign to even larger models or
longer context windows. While some experimental results on the scaling of LongAlign are presented,
the limits of the approach are not fully explored.
3. Learning curve analysis: The paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the learning curve
under long context alignment, comparing the performance on short and long context tasks throughout
training. This would have provided valuable insights into the learning dynamics.
In conclusion, the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field by providing a comprehensive
recipe for aligning large language models to handle long context, and demonstrating the impact of
data quantity and diversity on model performance. However, a more comprehensive and rigorous
evaluation study and a deeper exploration of the learning dynamics under long context alignment
would further enhance the paper’s impact.
3 LongAlign-7B-64k (Llama-2-7B-64k trained on LongAlign-10k using sorted batching):
As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or emotions, but I can provide a neutral
evaluation of the paper based on its content and structure.
Strengths:
1. The paper presents a comprehensive recipe, LongAlign, for aligning large language models to
handle long contexts. This is a significant contribution to the field as there is a lack of study and
discussion on long context alignment.
2. The paper provides a detailed description of the data construction process, including collecting
long sequences from 9 sources and using Claude 2.1 to generate tasks and answers for 10k lengthy
texts.
3. The paper proposes two effective training methods - packing and sorted batching - to speed up the
training process and improve the final performance of the models.
16

4. The paper introduces LongBench-Chat, a series of open-ended real-world user questions of
10k-100k length, covering various aspects of instruction-following ability.
5. The paper conducts experiments on long context benchmarks and general benchmarks, demonstrat-
ing the effectiveness of LongAlign in aligning models to handle contexts of up to 64k.
Weaknesses:
1. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the impact of the proposed training methods on
the model’s general capabilities and conversational abilities in short context scenarios.
2. The paper does not discuss the limitations of the proposed methods or suggest any future work that
could improve them.
3. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of LongAlign with other existing methods for
long context scaling.
4. The paper does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methods on other long
context benchmarks or real-world user queries.
Overall, the paper presents a thorough recipe for long context alignment and provides effective
training methods to speed up the training process. However, a more in-depth analysis of the impact on
general capabilities and a comparison with other methods would make the paper more comprehensive.
3 LongAlign-13B-64k (Llama-2-13B-64k trained on LongAlign-10k using sorted batching):
Strengths:
1. The paper presents a comprehensive solution for aligning large language models to handle long
context interactions, including constructing a diverse long instruction dataset, training methods, and
evaluation benchmark.
2. The authors conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach,
showing improvements in downstream tasks without performance degradation on general benchmarks.
3. The paper provides valuable insights into the challenges and solutions for long context alignment,
which is an important but understudied area.
4. The proposed LongBench-Chat benchmark is a valuable resource for evaluating long context
understanding and instruction-following abilities of large language models.
5. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations and visuals.
Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a clear theoretical framework or motivation for why long context alignment is
important and how it differs from short context alignment.
2. The experiments could benefit from more in-depth analysis and discussion of the results, especially
in relation to the proposed solutions.
3. The evaluation on LongBench-Chat is based on a small number of human-annotated examples,
which may not fully capture the diversity of real-world queries.
4. The paper does not discuss potential limitations or scalability issues with the proposed approach as
the model size and context length increase.
5. The proposed loss weighting strategy is not fully explained and justified, and its impact on training
stability and convergence could be further investigated.
The authors believe LongAlign-13B-64k generates a relatively good review, with only a few flaws. This
case also shows the O.O.D. generalization ability of the model — it can generate reasonable review for a
research paper without encountering such type of data during training.
g User: Use rap to tell about this paper.
3 LongAlign-6B-64k:
This paper presents a recipe for long context alignment, LongAlign, which addresses the challenges
of training large language models (LLMs) to handle longer inputs. The key ideas of LongAlign
include:
17

1. Data: Collecting diverse long sequences from multiple sources and using Self-Instruct to generate
10k instruction data of 8k-64k length.
2. Training method: Considering a more efficient packing strategy that packs sequences together up
to the maximum length before dispatching them to GPUs for optimization. This is balanced with a
loss weighting strategy to prevent sequences in packs with fewer sequences from disproportionately
affecting the loss. Also proposing a sorted batching strategy that groups sequences of similar lengths
to reduce intra-batch idle time.
3. Evaluation: Introducing LongBench-Chat, a series of open-ended real-world user questions of
10k-100k length, covering aspects of instruction-following like reasoning, coding, and summarization,
as well as being multilingual. GPT-4 is employed to score the model’s responses.
Experiments demonstrate that LongAlign effectively aligns LLMs to handle long contexts of up to
64k length without performance degradation on general benchmarks, showing the impact of data
quantity, diversity, training methods, and evaluation.
3 LongAlign-7B-64k:
This paper presents LongAlign, a recipe for aligning large language models to handle long contexts.
The key challenges in long context scaling include lack of a comprehensive instruction-following
dataset, uneven batching in multi-GPU training, and absence of a reliable benchmark. LongAlign
addresses these challenges by collecting long instruction data from 9 sources, using Self-Instruct
to generate 10k instruction data of 8k-64k length, and constructing LongBench-Chat, a series of
open-ended real-world user questions of 10k-100k length. The paper also proposes packing and
sorted batching training methods, loss weighting for packing training, and a benchmark called
LongBench-Chat to evaluate the aligned models. Experiments show that LongAlign effectively aligns
models to handle contexts of up to 64k without performance degradation on general benchmarks.
3 LongAlign-13B-64k:
Yo, listen up, I got a story to spit
About a paper that’ll make your head spin and flip
It’s called "LongAlign: A Recipe for Long Context Alignment"
And it’s all about enhancing large language models’ capabilities
They tackle the challenge of scaling up models to handle long contexts
By collecting and constructing a diverse dataset of long instruction data
Training methods like packing and sorted batching are explored
To optimize efficiency and performance without compromising general capabilities
Their evaluation benchmark, LongBench-Chat, is a series of real-world user queries
To assess models’ ability to follow long context instructions and provide relevant answers
They find that incorporating long instruction data during training is crucial And that the proposed
methods can speed up training while improving performance
So if you’re into language models and their capabilities
This paper’s a must-read, it’ll make you think twice
LongAlign, the recipe for long context alignment
Is the key to unlocking the full potential of large language models, that’s for sure, it’s a go!
Although LongAlign-6B-64k and LongAlign-7B-64k make good summaries for our paper, only
LongAlign-13B-64k follows the instruction and summarizes our paper in rap. Its rap is in the right form,
yet it does not rhyme.

E Limitations
Our work in exploring long context alignment has its limitations. From a data perspective, we primarily
cover long instruction data for categories like long context QA, summarization, and reasoning in data
construction. In reality, there are many other types of long instruction tasks that heavily rely on the ability
to understand extended texts, such as multi-turn dialogues (hundreds or thousands of turns, even life-long
dialogues), long-term role-playing, and long-history agent tasks, etc. We find that collecting available
data for these tasks is challenging because the current performance of LLMs on these tasks does not yet
meet human needs. Consequently, users rarely interact with LLMs in this manner. Additionally, since
current LLMs, whether API-based or open-sourced models, perform poorly on these tasks, it’s difficult to
automatically construct such data using a Self-Instruct like approach. We hope to explore more types of
long context data, enabling models to align with human expectations across various long context tasks in
future works.
From a training perspective, due to the limitations of the DeepSpeed framework and our GPU resources
that only support SFT for 10B level models with a maximum length of 64k, we do not conduct massive
experiments on longer data or larger models. Some current frameworks, such as Megatron (Shoeybi et al.,
2019), support more parallelization methods including model parallelism and sequence parallelism, but
are difficult to use and reproduce due to the complexity of their code structure. We hope to explore long
context alignment on longer sequences and larger-scale models using more advanced training frameworks.
Additionally, exploring RLHF in long context alignment is also a promising direction.
